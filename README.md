# node-skeleton

> Get started with Node projects quickly

#### What does this package do?

Use this to get started with a new project quickly, with the following already set up:

- Directory structure
- ESLint
- Mocha
- Travis
- License
- README

# Install

```
git clone https://github.com/mattdean1/node-skeleton <new project name>
cd <new project name>
rm -rf ./.git
git init
git remote add origin <new project url>
git commit -am "Initial commit"
git push -u origin master
npm install
```

# Usage

Once you've followed the steps above you can find and replace `node-skeleton` with your new project name and get started!

It's best to follow a consistent format with the README, so I left the headings in this file.
